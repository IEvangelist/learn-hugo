## Hugo Commands

Let's start by finding the desired working directory for the hugo site. This directory will be the location in which you develop your site and also serve as your local git repository, more on that later. Execute the following command to create a new hugo website.

```
hugo new site learn-hugo
```

Change directory, navigating into the newly created site folder. Then, open __Visual Studio Code__ in with this folder as the command line argument.

```
cd learn-hugo && code .
```
