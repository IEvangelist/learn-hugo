## Configure Remote

From the __Git__ command line, if you were execute `git remote -v` it will tell you what remote branches are configured. The list should be empty right now, but let's change that.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/IEvangelist/learn-hugo.git
```

```
Î» git remote -v
upstream        https://github.com/IEvangelist/learn-hugo.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/IEvangelist/learn-hugo.git (push)
```
