# Up & Running with Hugo

## Welcome to "Up and Running with Hugo".

Dynamic websites built with platforms like Wordpress are a dying breed, giving way to static websites. Tools like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) are leading the charge. In this talk we'll discuss what __Hugo__ is and how you can leverage it to build a blog site. Literally in a matter of minutes you'll have a professional looking blog site up and running. We'll cover how to host it entirely for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Finally, we'll cover how to synchronize __GitHub__ & __Netlify__, such that commits to your remote branch automatically build and deploy your blog site.
